* Using R Notebooks to understand your data
* Building machine learning and linear models
* Communicating results with Shiny and flex dashboards

## Machine Learning

The `ML_Modeling` directory also contains introductory examples of how to use these new R packages:

* [sparklyr](http://spark.rstudio.com/)
* [tensorflow](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/)
* [keras](https://rstudio.github.io/keras/reference/index.html)
